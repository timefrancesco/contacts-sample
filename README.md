# contacts sample app
This is a sample project I made for a job interview

The project was build in just few hours, some bugs could be there.  
To compile it:  

1) Clone this repository (or download the zip file)  
2) If you don't have cocoapods installed, [install it](https://cocoapods.org)  
3) In a terminal run `pod install` from whithin the project folder  
4) Open the `totvs-contacts-test.xcworkspace` file in Xcode  
5) Build and run!  

Important: The app requires an internet connection to work. It downloads a list of contacts from a sandbox api service.    
I am using [getsandbox](https://getsandbox.com) as api service, it's really simple to set up and it took me just 5 minutes including registering to it, really!
